DATA LAYER: Repositories <=> Data Providers  <=> Models

Model: It is a blueprint to the data your application will work with.
    A model should not be completely linked to the data.
    Should be independent of the source
    Should be Generic and Universal to the multiple data sources.

Data Provider: Provides the raw data to the repository sublayer.
    Eg. APIs to fetch the data from the internet (http.get, http.post etc)
    The return type of the API class functions should not be the MODEL, but type of the RAW Data received from the data source.

REPOSITORY: Part of data layer through wich Bloc communicates. Prepares the data and sends it to the Bloc layer.
    Wrapper around one or more Data Providers.
    Model classes are instantiated as objects here.
    A class which contains dependencies of their respective data providers.



BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER:
    Intermediate bw Presentation layer and Data layer
